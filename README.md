# Pokémon Crystal - Custom Starter ROM

This is a **non-PSR-official, modified** version of the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal. Modifications are made to offer starter customization for the player, as well as workarounds for RNG manipulations and spinners.

It builds the following ROM:

- Pokemon Crystal pokecrystal.gbc `sha1: 2b9f27193f47e57c925cf17b4557fe53c5b199fa` `crc32: 9E1B6E42`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Main changes
- Custom starter menu available before New Game, through the Option menu.
- 5 Repels given by Elm's Assistant when exiting the Lab the first time.
- 5 Master Balls given in exchange of Poké Balls by Elm's Assistant when exiting the Lab the second time.
- Route 29 : only L2-3 Sentrets during Morning/Day times.
- Route 30 : only L4 Hoppips during Morning/Day times, only L4 Poliwags during Night time.
- Route 31 : only L5 Bellsprouts during Morning/Day times, only L4 Poliwags during Night time.
- Randomly spinning trainers (or "spinners") have been adjusted to guarantee a dodge with an average reaction time.
- Douglas (spinner in Mahogany Gym) faces away from the player's path.
